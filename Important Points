1.Static Factory Methods instead of COnstructors : 

a) They have names
b) check on duplicate object creation (instance-controlled) 
c)A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type 
d) A fourth advantage of static factory methods is that they reduce the verbosity
of creating parameterized type instances.

Static factory methods disadvantages:
When providing only static factory methods, classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.
They are not readily distinguishable from other static methods

2. Minimize mutability - five points to remember
Don’t provide any methods that modify the object’s state (known as mutators).
Ensure that the class can’t be extended
Make all fields final
Make all fields private
Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components

3.  Prefer interfaces to abstract classes
Existing classes can be easily retrofitted to implement a new interface
Interfaces are ideal for defining mixins
Interfaces allow the construction of nonhierarchical type frameworks
Interfaces enable safe, powerful functionality enhancements
